This github repository is a fork of the repository hosted on 
[Combat Manager's Sourceforge Site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/combatmanagerpf/). 
The project hasn't seen any activity by the original author in the last year, so I've forked it here 
and will try to make a few improvements and bug fixes whenever I can. Mostly there's an occasional 
crash I keep getting while using the software on Windows that I would like to eventually fix.

Please refer to the website linked above and the Sourceforge project page for more information and 
to find the original author.
